# 🔍 Cross-Platform Packet Sniffer (Python GUI)

## 🧠 Overview

This is a cross-platform packet sniffer tool built with Python and Tkinter for educational and internship purposes. It captures network packets in real time, parses key information (source IP, destination IP, protocol, payload), and displays logs in a GUI interface. Users can apply filters, run commands, and export logs. The tool is compatible with both Windows and Linux systems.
